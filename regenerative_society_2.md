### Arguement overview

- change the world
- the world is persisting patterns
- how do you change such patterns? 
- can you build patterns? 
  - complicated vs. complex
  - you can only grow complex patterns
  - mvp patterns
    - stable
    - evolving
    - selection pressures

- cautionary note on anti-patterns
  - install kill switches?

My friends and I are interested in living in a different world. Some of us want to not suffer and die in climate change, some to see stateless democracy succeed the nation state.
I would like us to [join the galactic council](http://hyper.mixmix.io/?mixmix/blogposts/blob/master/uncapturable_distribution.md).
There are many common threads to our different visions and the paths we think we need to take to get there, things like more equality, reformation of economies, alternative modes of organising with large groups.

Something all these have in common is bringing about change in what already exists. Knowing how to effect change well is a VERY HARD problem - it's involves balancing things like a need for scale with preservation of values, or balancing inclusivity with alacrity.
When you're changing an economy, or how your company makes decisions, or societal behaviour, it's a multi-facetted problem. I think the most useful way to think about it is with a [**systems theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) perspective.
In short, while we have discrete labels and titles for objects, entities, or institutions, these are just constructions of convenience and what you're actually looking at is a system of interweaving patterns with fuzzy boundaries. 
(Note I've extended systems theory by adding the concept of a **pattern** - a small eddie within a system - so that we can still practically name commonly occuring 'chunks' of systems while acknowledging the ambiguity of their boundary)

### Examples (needs work)

  - **atoms** - we can think of them like little balls which bounce around. A more accurate description is a fuzzy probability distribution. Describing atoms like this lets us understand why some atoms can overlap, and why it's photosynthesis is possible 
  - **human diet** - some people's digestion doesn't work well. If you think this problem more as a system of patterns where the dancers are things like: my DNA which has built my intestine, the garden of microbes which are playing roles, the food and water systems I engage with (which is influenced by state policy and corporate advertising), my current body state (effected by my last meal, my relationship with colleagues and partner(s)) ... etc.

  - **worker happiness** : in our company do i get to be involved in decision that effect me? , who are the stakeholders, what's in the constitution, can we change the constitution, how do we employ people, how does power manifest, which country are we in, does our company designation make it easy / hard for other institutions to interact / invest in us? 

It might seem like adding a lot of complexity unnecessarily, but if you've ever tried tackling a difficult problem you've probably felt the pain of too much discrete labeling.
So if the world is made up of systems of patterns how do you change existing systems/ patterns or build new ones?

What is the nature of systems and patterns? 

Systems are complex (as distinct from complicated). Humans like building things up out of lots og predictable components - a car or a computer and complicated, because the individual parts are simple, and behaviour is easy to predict. Hard problems are typically dynamic systems - the global climate, my digestion, the economy are complex because they involve parts which interact in ways that are highly interdependant and hard to predict.

Most of the places we want to bring about change involve changing a system that is complex. This is important to understand because the way you approach a problems depends a lot on whether it's complicated or complex. I can fix software by understanding the limited number of ways the parts of the code can interact, then running some simple checks at the places it must be failing. I can design aa building out of concrete and steel by modelling physical forces and then employing a construction firm to execute the design.
__<< Complicated things are more likely to be static patterns >>__

In contrast, the way someone uses the software I have made is very hard to predict - what assumptions and previous experience is this person bringing, what's their culture, how were they introduced, and what are they trying to do? For this reason it's best practice to build software iteratively, by building, then testing with real users, then building again etc. It's a complex problem, so it's hard to predict, so we take a more adaptive approach.
__<< the line between complicated and complex is also blurry >>__


I'd like to suggest the best way to interact with complex systems in general is to grow patterns.
What's a pattern : it's a part of a system that persists.
Examples of patterns are the human genome, and related (but arguably somewhat at a distance) human culture, democracy (an instance of a large scale human governance pattern), Google (an instance of a class of pattern we call companies)

How did these patterns come into being and grow? 
I think their are some commonalities. They all have:
 - A) elements of stability
 - B) a mechanism to evolve/ change what is stable
 - C) sources that define fitness/ success (or provide selection pressure)
       __<< this may just be another type of stability? >>_

examples : 
- **humans genome**
  - A: genes within DNA. stability is ensure by accurate copying of DNA, redundancy through double up of chromosomes needed, self-repair code
  - B: sex (random recombination of parent DNA), low rate of point mutation
  - C: world interacting with body the DNA builds leading to natural selection of some versions of genome over generations (somewhat simplified)

- **Democrac**
  - A: Law + enforcement, serving citizen patterns by offering protection & infrastructure, promise of participation in pattern modification, international agreements
  - B: government, elections, lobbying
  - C: corporations, other nations, citizens, democratic theory

- **Communis**
  - A: Militarily enforced compliance to rules, promise of equality, promise of serving citizens 
  - B: government ... (I don't know how communist states evolve)
  - C: other nations, party memebers, citizens 

- **Google**
  - A: Legal structure (relationship with a nation), monopoly on niche money-making position (internet advertising), building a free to use platform that embeds feeding niche, making it hard for competion, and hard for users to leave.
  - B: 20% time, aquiring companies with new tech, expanding into new markets (android), ..  
  - C: apple, facebook, users, other companies

These are fairly shallow analyses, but hopefully they reveal some of the sorts of dependancy that patterns have. In particular it's interesting to consider the patterns a pattern is build from (for example companies and citizens with a democratic nation) and the patterns that a pattern interacts with (for example a country interacting with out countries, the environment, and trans-national organisations). \

I suspect these are worth considering because how patterns interact withing a system over the long term can help us predict how likely a pattern is to persist. 

The USSR as a communist state has not persisted because they didn't establish within their pattern the right balance of stability within their system and between their system and others.
French revolution - not enough stability with citizens

When the pattern involves humans :
