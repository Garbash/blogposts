Immortal patterns; or "How to join the galactic council" 
========================================================

We have the pleasure of living in a world full of a delightful array of organisms. These represent the progress so far - millions of years of matter learning how to arrange itself increasingly effective self-replicating patterns.
Even more delightful is the fractal growth of these patterns - a progression from DNA molecules, through cells with organelles, through organisms with many cells arranged as organs, through communities of organisms in ecosystems.
As humans, we're in the intesting position of being a part of a pattern that has the ability to observe patterns around us and manipulate them.

Can looking at this lineage of pattern inform how we should look to organise and communicate?

Perhaps we can inquire as to what made these patterns successful.
Well at the very least these patterns have persisted. 
To persist they have : 
  - self replicated
  - evolved
  - stabilised / persisted equilibrium state of surrounding broader patterns (have stable interactions with surrounding patterns) , establish equilibrium with connected patterns.
    
### Equlibrium state

Equilibrium state represents a long term stability of a pattern.
This is important particularly for more complex patterns (such as ourselves) which have operating ranges outside of which they cannot persist.
It's worth noting that stable does not necessarily mean good - for example humans being extinct is a stable possibility, even if it is a sad loss of complexity.

### Evolving state

Given all the systems we're engaging with are evolving, any system we build must also evolve.
The alternative is ultimately being outcompeted by an evolving system.  

examples: biological cells
- binary fission
- mutation, sex
- don't kill mutualistic relationships


Organisation as pattern
-----------------------

A successful community/ business pattern is one that persists.
To persist it has to self-replicate, evolve, and have stable interactions with connecting patterns. 

Current organisational patterns are in stable interaction with their connecting patterns.
We see this in patterns both above and below the level of the organisation-level.
Below - inequality is progressively crushing the poor. This plays out as inceasingly unstable countries.
Historically this instabilty leads to dramatic change of organisational level pattern through revolt or revolution.
Above - planet-wide environment is shifting towards a range that may preclude our particular pattern.

If we persist the our current organisational patterns, ... well, we can't

So our ideal organisation need to : 
 - self replicate
 - evolve
 - interact stablly with patterns (below, above, around) 


Building the ideal organisation
-------------------------------

To persist in the long term it has to be, adaptive, self-repairing, and to reach an equilibrium state in it's interactions with other systems. 

 find an equilibrium with its environment which does not forebear its persistence .

 organisations of atoms 

Build an organisation that builds itself.


What are the pre-requisites? There are likely several solutions to this problem, just as there are many solutions to how organisms are put together. 

Organisations thrive when they are regenerative. This is the hypothesis we're working on.
Build an engine that sustains and grows individuals and relationships between individuals, and you can't help but bring about positive change.

How have we succeeded ? 

We value working on positive change in the work more than we value money.

NOTES 
- each system has a distinctive identity that is constantly reproduced in its communication and depends on what is considered meaningful and what is not
- identity is the persistance of pattern
