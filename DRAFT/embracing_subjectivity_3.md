# Intro

Design challenge : can you build twitter without a central server?

No objective Truth.

Why should you care : 
  - technically interesting
  - system which doesn't need good internet
  - resiliant?
  - political

The adventure so far

Interesting parts - challenges, decisions, funny noticings.

Strange emergment pattern - the more we build, the more we see a system that looks  like 'people space' / offline-world / like human society has for millenia.

Not mystical, it's just weird.
Is it similar constraints stimulating convergent evolution, or is that the container we've made makes it easy to pour our social intuitions into?
Open question.

## DRAFT stubs

Ultimately I hope to convince you that objective Truth is outmoded, and that by giving it up
we're on the edge of a rennaisance,  and that you should embrace subjectivity.

What I'm most excited to show you, is that by letting go of singular Truth - or embracing subjectivity -
we end up with systems which are digital but are converging to human 

we find ourselves with digital systems which behave kinda like how human society has behaved for millenia.


This pattern of realisation feels similar to the rennaisance: 
- the rejection of the single truth of the church

In the west the truth of the church with an objective (trancendntal) truth that was replaced by other objective truths (science).

But even in science we've learnt that truth is bounded - in that it's so highly conditional on context or environemnt

Objectiveness ---> radical subjectivity ---> no meaning or coherence
Duality inherited from Plato

It's been an interesting journey so far

Today we're going to take a tour of of the interesting challenges and learnings we've hit along the way 
We've been on this journey, and turned up a bunch of other interesting things along the way : 
  - if you build to these constraints, what emerges looks a lot like a digital map of human society


This is not biomimicry, I think it's convergent evolution


  - building tech without an objective Truth is a lot like how humans build socially

  - how humans have reacted for millenia

## PREP - outline ?

- short intro ~> hook

- scuttlebutt
  - what it looks like (v1)
  - how basic stuff works

- challenges
  - 

- necessary background (could do on the way)
- building 



## the hook
  - fun design question: build twitter without a central server?
    - no central user table
    - authorisation
    - spam
    - weight
    - offline / sync

  - turns out: patterns that emerges from this are fascinatingly similar to everyday life
    - traditionally objective (like plato's solids, capital T truth)
    - social (emergent truth, truth born out of many perspectives)

  basically like everyday 

if we build differently, our technical systems can be like our social systems

- here's 

## some background : 
  
  - scuttlebutt tech
    - gossiped
    - content-addressed
      - content-addressable storage
    - signed
      - public-private keys
    - linked
