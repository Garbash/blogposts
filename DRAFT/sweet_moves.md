# Sweet Moves

A collection of sweet moves / approaches / lenses I've learnt from friends


## Thank you for that feedback

Derek Razo

Giving (critical) feedback to people is a challenging thing to do.
If the first thing the recipient responds with is "thank you", it changes the dynamic dramatically - the giver feels heard and set at ease, and the receiver puts themself in a position of genuine listening and acknowledgement of opportunity for learning.

The ~opposite of this would be immediate refute, explanation, or aggressive counter-feedback.


## Personal Responsibility

Billy Matheson

Noticing when a person (yourself or other) are attributing responsibility outside of self when it would be more appropriate for individual to be taking personal responsibility.

## Dealing with complaints

Dor Garbash
When someone complains about something, it's good to first symphesize with them. Hearing a complaint and following with an emphatizing statement such as: "Sounds like this is something that is really bothering you" can put the attention back to their internal state, and gives them a chance to give you more context and become more reflective. Often people just want others to acknowledge their complaint. Following that asking them "How would you like this issue/occurance to happen otherwise?" Could lead to them offering a solution and perhaps even taking ownership for solving it.
