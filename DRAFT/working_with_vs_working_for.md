# Working with vs working for

I just had a really weird interaction with a prospective employer.
It went something like: 
> **me**: hey, this job you have advertised sounds cool. How would you feel about me working 3-4 days a week? I also happen to work with a group devs who are similarly talented (in code + communication), so if you want to scale the amount of work from 20 hours to 80 hours, I can basically be extended to meet your needs.
> **them**: that sounds interesting!
> ...
> **them** (later): you've proposed something which basically sounds like it is just a sweet deal for you and your friends. It's not proven, it seems like a lot of added complexity, I think we'll pass.

I came away feeling slightly disturbed, because I was honestly communicating what I thought was an awesome deal.

On closer reflection, I think I've been working differently than the norm, and sharing a window into my alternative reality might be of value.

For the last 4-5 years I've been working with and on projects in and around the [#enspiral](#enspiral) ecosystem.
Notice how awkward that sentence sounds? I think the crux of it is that most people (or the majority of their time) belongs exclusively to one company.

In contrast, I've been more like planetoid on an eccentric orbit - starting with contributing, owning, and guiding a company [`1`][loomio], then moving continusouly around contracts [`2`][traject], [`3`][webpunch], [`4`][sp], social initiatives [`5`][lifehack], [`6`][poc21], [`7`][climathon], and teaching [`8`][eda].

I'm used to being part of a community, helping friends with their projects (by being an extra hand, by being a fresh pair of eyes, by being an outside facilitator).
It's a reciprocal relationship between many people which is (for the most part) highly rewarding and supportive.

It has afforded me a healthy living, opportunity to meet new people from different communities (nationally and internationally), plenty of learning, and the space to bring all my talents to bear.

I identify as less of an employeee and more of a community member who is remunerated for my contributions.
