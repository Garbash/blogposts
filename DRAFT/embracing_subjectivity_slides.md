# What is subjective space?

What if ... 

no particular central node
no particular logical structure to sync with

---

# No server, no blockchain, no DHT?

![](http://www.quantabytes.com/assets/network_analyst/hairball.png)

---

# No central source of truth

truth is local
truth is synthesised, is subjective

# Identity 

**(in Patchbay)**

naming
imaging
@mentioning

algorithms for signifiers

---

# Local communities

no platform policies
self-awareness + ownership

self hosting, social signaling, boundaries

- git repos that I care about
- subjective naming

Understanding gossip flows
  - degrees of gossip
  - redundancy
  - locality 

---

Multi-device
  - merging identities
  - local keys you can plug into servers 
  - hyperlogs

---

Private groups
  - cost of decryption
  - updating groups
  - authorisation

How do you describe foreign lands when there are no common words for what you've seen ?
