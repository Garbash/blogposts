The solution I'm currently investing in is [**Secure Scuttlebutt** ](https://github.com/ssbc/docs). 
It's an open and secure decentralised database where distribution flows along trust lines, as determined by following (positive value) and flagging (negative value).

Anyone is free to build an app to interface (read/ write) with this database. The first app is a proof of concept messaging app called [**Patchwork**](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork). 

Check out a brief introduction

The Scuttlebutt team is planning to open beta Patchwork in November 2015.

An overview of scuttlebutt's solution to some know problems with distribution systems:

- [x] All open uncapturable system: the protocol is open and the database is open and distributed. People can only edit their own data and reference others.
- [x] Has an uncapturable solution to noise: distribution only flows along trust lines in the network.
- [x] Searchable: relevance is similarly determined by trust relationships in the network.

**(Which pitfalls have we missed?)**
