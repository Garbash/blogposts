# Group Smells

As a programmer, part of my daily rhythm includes talking about _'code smells'_.
Like a musky over-ripeness somewhere in your fridge, or unwanted acridity of burning plastic coming from your computer, they're a hint that nearby, something is amiss, and it's about to get worse.
In code it's usually that you've used a pattern that seems good when you write it, but as you add things around it, things get volatile - maybe like running too many appliances off a multi-board.

Patterns that are known to cause future instability we call _anti-patterns_.

Naming code smells helps us identify anti-patterns, prevent catastrophes, and support an evolving discourse about best and worst practice.

My flatmate just came back from a conference where she was pulling her hair out because the way the group was working together was sp counter-productive.
It occured to me that we're currently lacking a discourse about the anti-patterns in group-work.
I want to know what that _group-smells_ are. 

Here's a few we were able to name in my lounge just now: 


## People talking over each other

This one is easy.
In the best case, everyone just cares a lot about what you're talking about, and they're excited to share what the conversation is bringing up for them.

Other smell you might notice :
- anxiety about when you're going to get to speak
- 2 people having a conversatoin, while everyone else watches
- lots of loud people, no quiet people
- an old white guy opinion-fest

The anti-pattern :
- you've forgotten to establish a shared protocol for how talking in your group goes, and conversation has defaulted to loudest / most dominant 

Where this anti-pattern can lead :
- less listening
- less diverse opinion 
- shallow analysis

Patterns you might consider that help: 
- appoint a facilitator
- introduce a rule (e.g. talking stick, or you can only talk again after 2 other people have spoken)
- change the format



## "This is self-organised"

Self-organisation is a thing, but it doesn't grow just anywhere.
There are certain conditions in which it tends to work well, and many in which it doesn't

Some smells to watch out for :
- lack of clarity about where and how decision making is happening
- invitation to 'be the change' without any guidance/ support to do that
- no description of what or how self-organisation is going to occur
- founders deny their power and leadership
- not everyone feels empowered to intervene in group processes

The anti-pattern : 
- you think you're making space for an ecosystem to magically appear, but you forgot to resource it 

Where this anti-pattern can lead :
- invisible power structures which priviledge some actors without them being aware of it
- emergent inside / outside groups
- poor communication systems that lead to distrust
- people taking on too many things and burning out
- white men dominating lots of things, women doing administrative roles

Patterns which support self-organisation : 
- naming power / leadership roles that exist
- actively sharing roles around
- making decision making processes clear
- clear communication systems


## Rabit hole

This is a short hand for a smell which looks like a conversation suddenly diving into way too much detail.

You might also smell:
- a shift from high level planning into actually solving the problem
- the phrase "well, technically.."
- two people debating a point while half the groups eyes glaze over
- detailed explanations well beyond what is needed for basic understanding
- your meeting is about to end, then gets railroaded

The anti-pattern :
- you haven't developed a group sense of the right time for the right conversation

Where this anti-pattern can lead :
- massive waste of group time
- spilt / diverted attention (less effective group)

Patterns to consider : 
- use an agenda
- start by clarifying 'what are we aiming to achieve here', and refer back to that
- have a way to 'stow' topics for later deeper conversation
- call 'rabit hole' when you smell one
