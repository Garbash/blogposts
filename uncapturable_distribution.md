Cobudgeting and Trust networks : roads to the Galactic Council
==============================================================

I've hosted two workshops this year where the highest named goal was humanity joining the Galactic Council. 

So I hang out with a bunch of big dreaming nerds with a bunch of different interests, but when we explore what it is we want in our future, it's a happy, thriving civilisation. You'll know we're there because we'll be looking after each other, curiously exploring, sharing our successes, and making intergalactic friends.

The workshops were about developing a Theory of Change for each group.

In each workshop, 2 hours of conversation made barely a dent in completing a fully detailed map, but we'd revealed a lot of territory.

Workshop 1 : Is our work climate change work? 
---------------------------------------------

[details to follow]


Workshop 2 : Why build a decentralised database?
------------------------------------------------

The tree we created was a branching tree. Here's what the top of it looked like :



If we start with our highest value and back-cast through our dominant arc of dependencies, it reads :

1. Galactic council
2. Civilisation-wide social harmony
3. Post scarcity
4. Distribution primarily in service of society 
5. Distribution is distributed and un-ownable
6. We build our distribution on un-capturable technologies

We tested our thinking about distribution problems against several real-world examples - of food and goods (supermarkets, wal-mart), and of information (email, google, facebook).

We observed that ownership of distribution by actors mainly interested in profit has lead to problematic dynamics which block us from joining the Galactic Council. See massive food waste, destruction of diversity through monopoly, development of tools which optimise addiction and consumption, development of tools which define value for us.


### Email

Email is a super successful open protocol. Anyone can send emails to anyone. The failing of email is that it has no mechanism for dealing with un-wanted noise (see spam).
This has generated a niche for organisations to offer value (spam filtering), and capture users. 
For example Gmail is popular because it does fairly reliable spam filtering. This makes email less open, because small private servers have a harder time generating a good 'not-spam' reputation.

Distribution systems must have a solution to noise

### Facebook

Facebook is built on an open protocol - http - but has centralised closed databases, and a closed (proprietary) interface.
Facebook's primary motivation is profit, which inclines it to leverage it's closed-ness (right of refusal of access) to extract value from it's user-base. 

Open protocols are not sifficient to ensure as uncapturable distribution system.
