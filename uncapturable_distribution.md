![On the road to The Galactic Civilisation](images/galaxy.jpg)

I've hosted two workshops this year where the highest named goal was humanity joining the Galactic Council. 

So I hang out with a bunch of big dreaming nerds with a bunch of different interests, but when we explore what it is we want in our future, it's a happy thriving civilisation. You'll know we're there because we'll be looking after each other, curiously exploring, sharing our successes, and making intergalactic friends.

The workshops were about developing a Theory of Change for each group.

In each workshop, 2 hours of conversation made barely a dent in completing a fully detailed map, but we'd revealed a lot of territory.

Workshop 1 : Is our work climate change work?

Workshop 2 : Why build a decentralised database?
