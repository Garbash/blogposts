Facilitators swap
=================

Symptoms
--------

You have a meeting coming up next week, and as you plan for it you notice:

- the meeting might run better if it was guided 
- you'd like the whole team to participate
- your past meetings have often run over time or have felt frustrating

If you're noticing 2 of these, you'd probably benefit from an **external facilitator**.

_facilitator : someone who supports a group process (like a meeting) to run more effectively by tuning the meeting as it runs in order to reach better outcomes. This can range from quite prescriptive to quite subtle interventions._ 

Solution steps
--------------

1. Clarify the purpose of your meeting
2. Find and book [facilitator](http://facilitators.enspiral.com)
3. Spend 15 mins with the facilitator clarifying expectations + sketching a runsheet
4. Run the meeting

Theory + Broader Strategy
-------------------------

###Why facilitation matters

Facilitation is a great way to support a group process to be clearer and more timely. The greatest gain is probably in helping to acheive a more productive balance of communication within the group. Different people have different modes and formats they contribute best in. If this isn't accounted for it's quite easy for one mode / format to prevail and for the process to be dominated by a small number of people. If this happens, you're likely to miss important perspective, and the decisions you're making are likely to be poorer.

###Hypotheses

Employing external facilitators : 
- adds perspective + objectivity 
- accelerates the learning and sharing of valuable skills
- strengthens networks by providing an opportunity for context and information exchange
- explicitly demonstrates the value of facilitation

So far, we've testing across Craftworks, Loomio, Enspiral Academy, Rabid, and Action Station. Facilitators involved so far include (Mix, Rich, Silvia, Breccan, Marrianne)

Types of group processes 
------------------------

It is useful is to distiguish the type of group process you're running. In particular knowing whether you're in a meeting or a workshop will help avoid a lot of tension. A _meeting_ tends to deal with short term strategy, for example checking in on progress, and surfacing new information, and planning next steps. A _workshop_ tends to be more operational (implimentation focused) and will involve diving into specific details.

Processes that facilitators could help run:

- meeting
  - retrospective : a ~90 minute guided review of project/ period of time
- workshop
  - an upskilling session on a particular topic (e.g. agile methodology, design thinking, ...)
  - a session where the team works to process or develop solutions to a particular problem

Derek's comments
----------------

Wow, first thing I notice is what a joy your writing style is to read. Really to the point and focused, well categorized and formatted. Great content UX. Very much a treat.

I noticed you have a couple different "what, why hows" mixed together in here. i wonder if it might be nice to make that thought pattern a bit more explicit.

I think "types of workshops" could be it's own article in full- doens't give me much in this context. Maybe shorten and reference to another piece. In fact I wonder if there might be 2 or 3 small articles nested in here.

I reckon the language of this could use some simple tweaking to take it to another level. 


Things I would tweak:
- "Symptoms" is a weird way to frame a value proposition. I think the content in that section is also the weakest in the article. Could possibly be replaced or synthesized with "hypothesis"

- Hypothesis is confusing language, could as easily be "why having external fascilitators is awesome" or some such thing

Would love to see a bit more in the "were experimenting in X" section, just with a quickie personal perspective on how it's been valuable.

I would love to see this be a bit less enspiral-centric, but I like the practicality that brings.

Q: what if I don't know any fascilitators?

Also, the recipie bit doesn't give me any directions on how to get / distribute funds. I reckon make a hard choice about enspiral intenal focus of this article (or not) and go into as much detail as needed.
